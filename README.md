Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a profession of creating,developing and maintaining software application.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering machine - here before you can do something with computer you have to understand machine language.
Mastering process - in this period of time you do not need machine language but a sytax and sementics of a particular programming language
.
Mastering complexity here you just need to know how to arrange in a detailed and uniqe approach because  AI can do everthing for you.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - in this phase we are to find out the purpose and scope of our software.

Requirement analysis - here we identify the tools and  end user value that our software can generate .


design - in this phase we design the architectural frame work of the software.

coding - this puting the dreams into reality were the magic happens

testing - after coders are done then its time to see the quality of what we built by puting it to action and record the reaction.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - this people develope and maintain software using programming languagues such as python, java,c++ etc.


Quality assurance -this guy is the brige between the stackholders and the programmmer in order to match the required instruction the directly solve the business challenge.


Project manager - this guys lead the software developement team to make that effective communication and colllaboration is well maintained
in order to create the dreamed software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development Enviroment is a software that enhence the creation of other software by enabling the programming languages Enviroment to write debuge and deploy a real code, it has almost everything a progrmmer need to easily write the code such as auto completion of code, arranging code in a colourful and stylish way etc.


version control system - is a tool that help the software team to manage changes to source code over time through collabration. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
time costraints

software security

changing software  requirement

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
AI prompt engeering is a process of writing a detailed instruction to AI for a better and clearer result.

AI propmt engineering is very important as it helps generate a more flawless and error free result which helps in maintaining debuging time.
It helps in generating information based on instructions given to it.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
write a java code that calculate the avarage salary of a police men in nigeria.
